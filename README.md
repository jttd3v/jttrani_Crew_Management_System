# Crew Management System Login Demo

This repository contains a simple responsive login page for a Crew Management System.

## Features

- Username/email and password fields
- Error message display for invalid input
- Password visibility toggle
- Maritime-themed background with 50% opacity
- Animated wave effect at the bottom of the page
- Responsive design optimized for desktop and mobile

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in your browser or serve the directory with a local web server.

This page is for demonstration purposes only. It performs a very basic front-end credential check and **should not** be used in production without a proper backend and secure authentication mechanism.

### Can I hide the page source?

No. Modern browsers allow users to view HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that are served to them. You can try techniques such as disabling the context menu or key shortcuts and minifying/obfuscating code, but a determined user can still access the source. Security should rely on robust server-side code rather than hiding client-side files.
